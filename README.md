# Perceptron

Perceptron is a linear Machine Learning algorithm used for supervised learning for various binary classifiers. 
This algorithm enables neurons to learn elements and processes them one by one during preparation.

Perceptron model is also treated as one of the best and simplest types of Artificial Neural networks.

Perceptron is considered as a single-layer neural network that consists of four main parameters:
- input values (Input nodes), 
- weights and Bias, 
- net sum, 
- and an activation function. 
 
The perceptron model begins with the multiplication of all input values and their weights, then adds these values together to create the weighted sum. 
Then this weighted sum is applied to the activation function 'f' to obtain the desired output. 
This activation function is also known as the step function and is represented by 'f'.
